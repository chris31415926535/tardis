Version: 0.1.5
Authors@R: person(given = "Christopher", 
    family = "Belanger",

Description: Measure text's sentiment with dictionaries and simple rules covering
    negations and modifiers. User-supplied dictionaries are supported, including
    Unicode emojis and multi-word tokens, so this package can also be used to
    study constructs beyond sentiment.
