Title: Text Analysis with Rules and Dictionaries for Inferring Sentiment (TARDIS)
Version: 0.1.2
Author: Christopher Belanger
Maintainer: Christopher Belanger <christopher.a.belanger@gmail.com>
Description: Analyze text with dictionaries and simple rules to measure sentiment, 
    or roughly how happy or sad text is. Tardis handles negations, so it knows 
    "not happy" means "sad", and it handles modifiers, so it knows that "very 
    happy" is more happy than "happy". Tardis also supports Unicode emojis and 
    multi-word tokens, so you can tell it that "supreme court" is neutral instead
    of a combination of "supreme" (positive) and "court" (neutral). Tardis 
    supports user-defined dictionaries and can be used to analyze other 
    constructs beyond sentiment.
