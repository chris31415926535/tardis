Title: Text Analysis with Rules and Dictionaries for Inferring Sentiment (TARDIS)
Version: 0.1.2.9000
Author: Christopher Belanger
Maintainer: Christopher Belanger <christopher.a.belanger@gmail.com>
Description: TARDIS uses simple rules and dictionaries to analyze text. By
    default it uses built-in dictionaries to measure sentiment, i.e. how happy 
    or sad text is. It handles negations, so it knows "not happy" means "sad",
    and it handles modifiers, so it knows that "very happy" is more happy than
    "happy". TARDIS also supports unicode emojis and multi-word tokens, so you
    can tell it that "supreme court" is neutral, instead of a combination of 
    "supreme" (positive) and "court" (neutral). TARDIS supports user-defined
    dictionaries and can be used to analyze other constructs beyond sentiment.
