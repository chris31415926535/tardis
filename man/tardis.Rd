\title{Text Analysis with Rules and Dictionaries for Inferring Sentiment (TARDIS)}
\usage{
tardis(
  input_text = c("I am happy.", "I am VERY happy!!", "‚ù§", "Not sad.", "Bad.",
    "Not bad.", "A happy sentence! And a sad one. In the same text."),
  text_column = NA,
  dict_sentiments = NA,
  dict_modifiers = NA,
  dict_negations = NA,
  sigmoid_factor = 15,
  verbose = FALSE,
  use_cpp11 = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_text}{Text to analyze, either a character vector or a data.frame with a column of text.}

\item{text_column}{If using data.frame input, the name of the column of text to analyze.}

\item{dict_sentiments}{Optional sentiment dictionary. A data.frame with two columns: `word` and `value`}

\item{dict_modifiers}{Optional modifiers dictionary. A data.frame with two columns: `word` and `value`}

\item{dict_negations}{Optional negation dictionary. A data.frame with one column: `word`}

\item{sigmoid_factor}{Numeric, default 15. Factor for scaling sentence scores to -1/+1 using sigmoid function.}

\item{verbose}{For debugging--should it print lots of messages to the console?}

\item{use_cpp11}{Boolean, working on cpp11 for optimization.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with one row for each input text and three new columns:
        `sentiment_mean`: the average sentiment for each sentence in each text.
        `sentiment_sd`: the standard deviation of sentence sentiments for each text.
        `sentiment_range`: the range of sentence sentiments for each text.
}
\description{
function takes a single text string with several sentences (e.g. a reddit post)
runs vaderish sentiment algorithm on each sentence
returns mean, sd, and range of sentiments so acquired
rationale: doesn't make sense to apply sentence-level analysis to paragraphs.
especially for online communications where people can use quick swings in sentiment
to express irony.
