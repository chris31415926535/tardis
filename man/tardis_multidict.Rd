\title{Analyze text with more than one dictionary}
\usage{
tardis_multidict(input_text, text_column = NA, dictionaries, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_text}{A text to be analyzed, either a `tbl_df` or a character vector.}

\item{text_column}{If `tbl_df` input, a character with the name of the input
column containing the text to be analyzed.}

\item{dictionaries}{A single `tbl_df` with columns `dictionary`, `token`, and
(optionally, for weighted dictionaries) `score`.}

\item{...}{Other parameters passed on to `tardis::tardis()`.}
}
\value{
A `tbl_df` with new columns for each dictionary.
}
\description{
This convenience function takes a text and a set of dictionaries, and calls
`tardis::tardis()` once for each dictionary. Other parameters are also passed
along to `tardis()`.
}
\details{
Dictionaries must be in a single `tbl_df` with at least two columns:
`token`, containing the tokens belonging to each dictionary; and `dicionary`,
 which contains a unique identifier mapping each token to a dictionary.
 Weights, if present, must be in a column named `score`.

 Tokens can be mapped to multiple dictionaries, but each row maps one token
 to one dictionary.
